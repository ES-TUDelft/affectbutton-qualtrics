# Using the AffectButton in Qualtrics Surveys

---

The affect button is used to collect users feedback via reporting their emotional state. It is based on the work by [Broekens et al.](http://joostbroekens.com).

In the following, we provide a step-by-step guide for integrating the affect button into a Qualtrics survey.
